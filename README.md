# Sequence Dice (Android)

A mobile remake of the board game **Sequence Dice**, built with **Java** and **Android**.  
This project implements the full game logic and rules of Sequence Dice in an interactive Android app.

## ðŸ“œ Game Rules

Sequence Dice is a variation of the Sequence board game designed for **2â€“4 players**.  

### ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Be the first player (or team) to complete:
- **5 tokens in a row** (2 players)
- **6 tokens in a row** (3â€“4 players)  
Tokens can be aligned **horizontally**, **vertically**, or **diagonally**.

### ðŸ›  Gameplay
- **Board**: 6x6 grid, cells numbered from **2 to 12**
- **Equipment**: 2 six-sided dice, colored tokens for each player/team
- **Turn Order**: Each player rolls the dice; highest total starts, then play proceeds clockwise

#### ðŸŽ² Dice Outcomes:
1. **Normal Roll** â€“ Place a token on an empty cell matching the dice sum.
2. **Occupied Cells** â€“ Replace an opponent's token if no empty matching cell exists. If all are your own, skip the turn.
3. **Roll a 2 or 12** â€“ Take an extra turn (in addition to placing/replacing a token).
4. **Roll a 10 (Defensive Roll)** â€“ Remove an opponentâ€™s token (except on protected grey cells: 2s and 12s).
5. **Roll an 11 (Wild Roll)** â€“ Place a token on any empty cell.
